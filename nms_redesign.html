                <p id="summary">To practice my UX/UI design skills, I chose to optimize the UX/UI of the inventory
                    management and crafting system in the video game No Man’s Sky after being frustrated countless times
                    trying to do basic tasks in a timely manner. I analyzed Steam discussion and Reddit posts/comments
                    to identify key pain points for players and discover what features players thought were missing from
                    the game’s inventory management and crafting system.</p>
                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p>In the video game No Man’s Sky, players are frustrated by the unintuitive UX/UI when trying to
                    accomplish basic tasks often enough that there are many specific complaints about the UX/UI on the
                    game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/">Subreddit</a> and
                    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/">Steam discussion boards.</a>
                    The challenge was to redesign the inventory and crafting menu in a way that made it more intuitive
                    to accomplish the variety of complex tasks.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <p>
                    I took an informal, qualitative approach by sorting through the game’s subreddit and Steam
                    discussion board to identify common problems players faced in-game and determine what features to
                    prioritize while redesigning the menu and crafting UI.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <p>
                    As a redesign challenge for myself, I conducted all the user research and designed the proposed UI.
                </p>
                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Steam discussion and Reddit posts/comments were a valuable source for qualitative information
                    concerning users thoughts about the current inventory and crafting UX/UI. Doing a simple search for
                    “ui” or “ux” in the subreddit shows multiple pages of posts dedicated to complaining about the
                    game’s UI.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <p>While reading through complaints about the UI, I took note of the key pain points users pointed out:</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Since much of the game is spent doing inventory management and crafting, many of the requested
                    features are important to making inventory navigation and crafting quicker; players do not want to
                    spend unnecessary amounts of time in their inventory.</p>

                </div>
                <p>From a personal perspective (and after playing the game for many hours), I could relate to other
                players' complaints. In the image above, notice that there are two submenus and the crafting menu
                only displays eight items at a time.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The natural discussion and ability to upvote and downvote on Reddit made it easier to prioritize
                    certain features. I prioritized the above features based off the post or comment with the most
                    upvotes containing said feature:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Better build menu</li>
                    <li>Intuitive inventory management</li>
                    <li>Reduce amount of scrolling</li>
                    <li>Reduce amount of submenus</li>

                <h1>Suggested Solution</h1>
                <p>The UX/UI of No Man’s Sky inventory and crafting interactions could benefit greatly by taking
                    inspiration from other games that also have inventory and crafting mechanics such as Minecraft,
                    Destiny, Unturned, and Rust.</p>
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>UX macro-level: The current inventory and crafting system is slow and clunky; it needs have a
                        major overhaul to give the player inventory a quick and responsive feel. Since the inventory and
                        crafting system is something that the player uses constantly throughout the game, even just
                        miniscule amounts of time wasted with each interaction can frustrate the player after they have
                        experienced it hundreds of times.<br><br></li>
                    <li>UX micro-level: Remove the need for players to hold down a button for many interactions such as
                        crafting. Allow players to have greater customizability with hotkeys, especially with switching
                        inventories. This would drastically reduce the amount of button presses and menus a player has
                        to go through to reach a desired inventory.</li>
                </ol>

                <h1>Proposed Solution and Low-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                <p>Based on the above suggested solution and the game’s current inventory screen, I first created a
                    low-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD to address all the key pain points I found through users.

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="two columns"><br></div>
            <div class="eight columns">
                <p>In the prototype, I dedicated the entire right side to crafting. Instead of a small pop-out menu that
                    only shows eight items at a time, I made the right side into a list of craftable items with
                    color-coding that shows what the player can and cannot craft. This greatly reduces the amount of
                    submenus and clicking a player has to go through to find and craft an item. I placed a button on top
                    of the list to switch to a model view of their inventory (spaceship model, player model, vehicle
                    model, etc.) to keep that functionality.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Above the inventory, I created a way to show all the player’s inventories at once. This way, the
                    player can drag and drop items to different inventories without switching screens. In addition, the
                    player can choose to quickly get to a different inventory by pressing the hotkey,  scrolling, or
                    clicking on them. On the top right of the inventory I also placed a button to sort the player’s
                    current inventory.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>While the redesign sacrifices the ability to see a recipe by hovering over the item, it removes the
                    need to scroll through many pages to find the item in the first place. Once the user finds it and
                    expands the recipe, it will be there for the player to reference any time they open their inventory.</p>

                <h1>High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                <p>To better visualize the proposed UI, I created a high-fidelity prototype in Photoshop based on the
                    low-fidelity prototype I made in XD:</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>While there are many UX/UI issues in the game, a rework of the inventory management and crafting
                    system needs to prioritized. These two aspects are the foundations of any survival game and it is
                    essential that players find them intuitive and responsive. Player experience would benefit
                    greatly by a more intuitive inventory and crafting system, reducing the amount of time wasted
                    doing simple tasks.</p>
