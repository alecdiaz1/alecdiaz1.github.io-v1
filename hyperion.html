                <p id="summary">In my senior year of high school, I served as the media director of a mock engineering
                firm known as Hyperion Industries. Our task was to build a robot known was Shere Khan that would have
                the ability to run, jump, climb, and attach modules to itself.</p>
            <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>As media director, my responsibilities were very diverse and included
                branding, graphic design, document design, video editing, and photography. My role in crafting the company's
                presentation was critical for fundraising; we fund-raised over $5000 to build the robot. Throughout the
                course of the school-year, I delivered brochures, Powerpoints, ID cards, video ads, water bottle
                labels, 8-foot high banners, designs for two 100-page documents, and a documentary.</p>
            <h1>Branding</h1>
                <p>Since the company was new, I first had to create the company brand. I informally surveyed members of
                the company asking them, <i>"What do you want people to think when they hear our company?"</i>
                Most responses included: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High-tech</li>
                    <li>Innovative</li>
                    <li>Modern</li>
                    <li>Bold</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    and other adjectives along those lines. With this information, I researched logos and design guidelines
                    of companies such as Boeing, Northrop-Grumman, and Tesla, companies that team members associated with the
                    adjectives above (we had a lot of future engineers). After many concepts, iterations, and feedback from
                    the team, the final result was this:

            </div>
        </div>
                <p>We were required to use red as our primary color but I knew that it was a powerful color. Using it to
                    its strength, I tried to take a simple yet effective approach and reflect our boldness
                    and drive for innovation in our logo.</p>
